tl;dr

This is my resume template in LaTeX that I created in grad school. I recommend [ShareLaTeX][1] for your LaTeX document needs.

Long version
------------
Setting up LaTeX on Windows is a pain. Frankly, it is not really to easy work with on Linux either. Well, gone are the days of missing class files and packages.

ShareLaTeX lets you create LaTeX documents in the cloud, think of it as LaTeX as a service. I was particularly impressed when I copied my grad school resume into ShareLaTeX and it compiled on the first try. That was amazing, considering it is LaTeX! And the cost behind the [web app][2] is on github!

I had given up on LaTeX but ShareLaTeX renewed my interest. I expect to use it more now that it is so easy to use. For starters, I thought it would be a good idea to share my resume template. Use it with ShareLaTeX for maximum benefit. ;)
