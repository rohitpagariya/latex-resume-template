tl;dr version: This is my latex resume template that I created in grad school. I recommend ShareLaTeX for your LaTeX document needs. 

I came across an awesome LaTeX web app recently, ShareLaTeX.com. 

Setting up LaTeX on Windows is a pain. Frankly, it is not really to easy work with on Linux either. Well, gone are the days of missing class files and packages. 

ShareLaTeX lets you create LaTeX documents in the cloud, writing and compiling. I was particularly impressed when I copied my grad school resume into ShareLaTeX and it compiled on the first try. That was amazing, considering it is LaTeX!

I am sharing my resume template written in LaTeX. Use it with ShareLaTeX for maximum benefit. ;)
